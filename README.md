OMG, just watched The Alto Knights and I have so many FEELINGS and THOUGHTS! Like, what was even happening? Idk, it's like they took every crime drama trope and threw it in a blender on high speed. But you know what? It kinda worked? Like, those epic car chases with the ridiculous soundtrackâ€”seriously, who doesn't love a good saxophone solo while chaos unfolds?

And don't even get me started on Marco's character arc! Like, one minute heâ€™s the classic tough guy with a heart of gold, but then itâ€™s like, okay dude, maybe chill a minute with the brooding? ðŸ˜‚ I mean, I've seen better, but also, weirdly satisfying?! 

Anyway, the scenes in the old town? Pure gold. You know, it's like you're there amidst all that historical drama. For a hot second, I was tempted to download the movie right away and watch it again just for those bits. Or wait, is that piracy? ðŸ˜‚ Ask me if I care.

> There's this part where Bella and Marco have that showdown in the rain and honestly, it was peak soap opera levels of drama but I was LIVING for it. Like, who writes these lines? Nobody talks like that in real life, but here I am, eating it all up anyway.

I gotta say though, by the end I was sooo ready for it to wrap upâ€”and then that ending! Out of nowhere and like, plot twist after plot twist. My brain straight-up short-circuited for a second, like, okay, but can I get a little closure, please??

int i=0; while(true){i++;} // LOL, why's this even in my head right now?

So yeah, if you haven't seen it yet, just watch the movie and trust me on this rollercoaster. Now, I'm gonna make a snack and maybe pretend I know how to be a mafia boss for a minute because why not? What's up with you?
